 We’re excited to share some updates on our progress at Omni-Hardware-Optimized (OHO). Since the inception of our original project, ai.god.mod, we’ve grown significantly and now have three proprietary AI models under development: do.ai, me.ai, and ra.ai.
ra.ai, also known as eNVI (Natural Video Input Environment), is a groundbreaking project focused on natural video input processing. While we’re keeping most details private for now, we look forward to sharing more as we near its official release.
In addition to our AI advancements, we’re thrilled to announce that our lead developer and co-founder has spearheaded the development of a video game titled Mork. Built on the Godot game engine, Mork is a Borg-inspired city builder, roguelike, and first-person RPG. We’re keeping the finer details under wraps for now but will provide more information as we approach the release.
Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to push the boundaries of innovation at OHO!
